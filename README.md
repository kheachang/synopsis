Extractive text summarizer based on [TextRank algorithm](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf).

> In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information ... In this paper, we introduced TextRank â€“ a graph-based ranking model for text processing.
